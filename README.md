# Starton API's Postman collection

The only one requirement for using this collection is [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

## How to import it

If you don't already have a Postman workspace you need to create one.  

Once your are in this workspace, use the top left *Import* button and import the collection and the environment variables.


## How to use it

Most of the values needed in the requests are automatically retrieved from the previous requests.  

If you want to update it, you just have to click on the collection -> *Variables*.

Therefore some variables are specific to you, they are those in the environment variables (the top right drop down list). You have to set them to your own values.

If you want to use this collection to store content on IPFS, you will need to select local files in the body of the requests.
